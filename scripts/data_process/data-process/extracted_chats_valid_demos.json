For instance, to find the average of values in cells B1 to B10, you would use the formula \"=AVERAGE(B1:B10)\".\n\t\n\t3.

For instance, the formula \"=IF(A1>10, \"Greater than 10\", \"Less than or equal to 10\")\" checks if the value in cell A1 is greater than 10 and returns the corresponding text based on the result.\n\t\n\tThese are just a few examples of commonly used formulas in Excel.

For example, you can use conditional formatting to:\n\t\n\t1. Highlight cells that are above or below a certain threshold.\n\t2.

Overall, SFG-SISO PI was considered the best controller, highlighting the superiority of looptune over LQR.
